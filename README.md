## üë®‚Äçüíª About

- This repository contains the sources for the documentation pages rendered
  to https://cratedb.com/docs/guide/. The content is optimally consumed
  from there.

- You can use the content and code snippets for educational and knowledge base
  purposes, or as blueprints for your own projects.

## üßê What's Inside

The main content tree of the CrateDB Handbook includes an array of topics,
roughly based on two approaches to convey information: A "learning path"
style documentation serving newcomers, and a "reference lookup" style
documentation serving experienced users.

If you are looking for something specific, please use the search feature on
GitHub, for example, [searching for "flink"], or clone the repository and
use a local search tool like `ripgrep` or the Silver Searcher.
