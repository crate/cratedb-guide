*Try CrateDB without installing*

If you want to try out CrateDB on Linux or macOS but would prefer to avoid the
hassle of manual installation or extracting release archives, you can get a
fresh CrateDB node up and running in your current working directory with a
single command:

.. code-block:: console

   sh$ bash -c "$(curl -L https://try.crate.io/)"


.. NOTE::

    This is a quick way to *try out* CrateDB. It is not the recommended method
    to *install* CrateDB in a durable way. The following sections will outline
    that method.
