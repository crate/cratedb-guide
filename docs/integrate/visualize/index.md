## hvPlot and Datashader

The `cloud-datashader.ipynb` notebook explores the [HoloViews] and [Datashader] frameworks
and outlines how to use them to plot the venerable NYC Taxi dataset, after importing it
into a CrateDB Cloud database cluster.

ðŸš§ _Please note this notebook is a work in progress._ ðŸš§

(plotly)=
## Plotly / Dash

- The `timeseries-queries-and-visualization.ipynb` notebook explores how to access
  time series data from CrateDB via SQL, load it into pandas DataFrames, and visualize
  it using Plotly.

  It includes advanced time series operations in SQL, like aggregations, window functions,
  interpolation of missing data, common table expressions, moving averages, JOINs, and
  the handling of JSON data.
