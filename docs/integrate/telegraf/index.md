:::{rubric} About
:::

[Telegraf] is a leading open source server agent to help you collect metrics
from your stacks, sensors, and systems. More than 200 adapters to connect
to other systems leaves nothing to be desired.

::::{dropdown} **Details**

Telegraf is a server-based agent for collecting and sending all metrics and
events from databases, systems, and IoT sensors. Telegraf is written in Go
and compiles into a single binary with no external dependencies, and requires
a very minimal memory footprint.

:::{rubric} Overview
:::

- **IoT sensors**: Collect critical stateful data (pressure levels, temperature
  levels, etc.) with popular protocols like MQTT, ModBus, OPC-UA, and Kafka.

- **DevOps Tools and frameworks**: Gather metrics from cloud platforms,
  containers, and orchestrators like GitHub, Kubernetes, CloudWatch, Prometheus,
  and more.

- **System telemetry**: Metrics from system telemetry like iptables, Netstat,
  NGINX, and HAProxy help provide a full stack view of your apps.
