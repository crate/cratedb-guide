:::{rubric} About
:::

[Gradio] is an open source programming framework for quickly creating and sharing
machine learning model demo applications, written in Python.

::::{dropdown} **Details**

- Creating a user interface only requires adding a couple lines of code to your project.
- It does not require any experience with HTML/JS/CSS, or web hosting.
- Gradio can be embedded in Python notebooks, or presented as a web application.
- Once you've created an interface, you can permanently host it on [Hugging Face].
