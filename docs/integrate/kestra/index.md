:::{rubric} About
:::

[Kestra] is an open source workflow automation and orchestration toolkit with a rich
plugin ecosystem. It enables users to automate and manage complex workflows in a
streamlined and efficient manner, defining them both declaratively, or imperatively
using any scripting language like Python, Bash, or JavaScript.

:::{dropdown} **Details**

Kestra comes with a user-friendly web-based interface including a live-updating DAG
view, allowing users to create, modify, and manage scheduled and event-driven flows
without the need for any coding skills.

Plugins are at the core of Kestra's extensibility. Many plugins are available from
the Kestra core team, and creating your own is easy. With plugins, you can add new
functionality to Kestra.
