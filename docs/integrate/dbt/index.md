[dbt] is an open source tool for transforming data in data warehouses using Python and
SQL. It is an SQL-first transformation workflow platform that lets teams quickly and
collaboratively deploy analytics code following software engineering best practices
like modularity, portability, CI/CD, and documentation.

> dbt enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same
> practices that software engineers use to build applications.

With dbt, anyone on your data team can safely contribute to production-grade data
pipelines.

The idea is that data engineers make source data available to an environment where
dbt projects run, for example with [Debezium](#debezium) or with [Airflow](#apache-airflow).
Afterwards, data analysts can run their dbt projects against this data to produce models
(tables and views) that can be used with a number of [BI tools](#bi-tools).

  and governance controls.
- Schedule, deploy, and monitor your data products using the scalable and reliable dbt
  Cloud Scheduler.
- Help your data teams discover and reuse data products using hosted docs or integrations
  with the powerful Discovery API.
- Extend your workflow beyond dbt Cloud with 30+ seamless integrations covering a range
  of use cases across the Modern Data Stack, from observability and data quality to
  visualization, reverse ETL, and much more.

## Install
Install the most recent version of the [dbt-cratedb2] Python package.
```shell
pip install --upgrade 'dbt-cratedb2'
```


## Connect
**dbt Profile Configuration:** CrateDB targets should be set up using the
following configuration in your `profiles.yml` file.
```yaml
company-name:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: cratedb
      host: [hostname]
      user: [username]
      password: [password]
      port: [port]   # Default is 5432.
      dbname: crate  # Fixed. Do not change.
      schema: doc    # `doc` is the default schema.
```
dbt-cratedb2 is based on dbt-postgres, which uses [psycopg2] to connect to
the database server.
Because CrateDB is compatible with PostgreSQL, the same connectivity
options apply like outlined on the [dbt Postgres Setup] documentation
page.
