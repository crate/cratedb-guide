:::{dropdown} **Managed Metabase**

With [Metabase Cloud], you will get a fast, reliable, and secure deployment
with none of the work or hidden costs that come with self-hosting.

- **Save the time** needed for setup and maintenance of the platform, focusing only on the insights we can get from our data.
- **Trustworthy, production-grade deployment** by people who do this stuff for a living.
  With the infrastructure, specialists, and thousands of Metabases in our cloud, we've put a lot of thought and resources into optimizing hosting.
- **Upgrades:** Automatically upgrade to the current version, so you're always getting the latest and greatest of Metabase.
- **Backups:** The way they should be: there when you need them, out of sight and out of mind when you don't.
- **SMTP server:** Even your alerts and dashboard subscriptions covered with a preconfigured and managed SMTP server.
