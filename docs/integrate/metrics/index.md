# Monitoring and Metrics with CrateDB

CrateDB integrations with metrics collection agents, brokers, and stores.
This documentation section lists applications and daemons which can
be used together with CrateDB, and educates about how to use them optimally.

Storing metrics data for the long term is a common need in systems monitoring
scenarios. CrateDB offers corresponding integration adapters.
