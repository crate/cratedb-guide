:::{rubric} About
:::

[Apache Hop] aims to be a modern, open source data integration platform that is
easy to use, fast, and flexible. It facilitates all aspects of data and metadata
orchestration.

:::{dropdown} **Details**

- **Visual development** enables developers to be more productive than they can
  be through code.

- **Workflows and pipelines** can be designed in the Hop Gui and run on the Hop
  native engine (local or remote), or on Spark, Flink, Google Dataflow or AWS EMR
  through Beam. _Design once, run anywhere._

- **Lifecycle Management** enables developers and administrators to switch between
  projects, environments and purposes without leaving your train of thought.
