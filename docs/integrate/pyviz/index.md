[hvPlot] is a familiar and high-level API for data exploration and visualization.
[Datashader][Datashader Homepage] is a graphics pipeline system for creating
meaningful representations of large datasets quickly and flexibly.

It is used on behalf of the [hvPlot] package, which is based on [HoloViews], from the
family of [HoloViz] packages of the [PyViz] ecosystem.

With Datashader, you can "just plot" large datasets and explore them instantly, with no
parameter tweaking, magic numbers, subsampling, or approximation, up to the resolution
of the display.

:::{div}
[hvPlot] sources its power in the [HoloViz] ecosystem. With [HoloViews], you get the
ability to easily layout and overlay plots, with [Panel], you can get more interactive
control of your plots with widgets, with [DataShader][Datashader Homepage], you can
visualize and interactively explore very large data, and with [GeoViews], you can
create geographic plots.
