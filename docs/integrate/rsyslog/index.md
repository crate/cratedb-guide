:::{rubric} About
:::

[Rsyslog] is a rocket-fast system for log processing.

It offers high performance, advanced security features, and a modular design.
Originally a regular syslogd, rsyslog has evolved into a highly versatile
logging solution capable of ingesting data from numerous sources,
transforming it, and outputting it to a wide variety of destinations.

Rsyslog can deliver over one million messages per second to local
destinations under minimal processing load. Even with complex routing
and remote forwarding, performance remains excellent.
