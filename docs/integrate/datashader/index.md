[Datashader], a member of the family of [HoloViz] packages, is a graphics
pipeline system for creating meaningful representations of large datasets
quickly and flexibly.

With Datashader, you can "just plot" large datasets and explore them instantly,
with no parameter tweaking, magic numbers, subsampling, or approximation, up to
the resolution of the display.
