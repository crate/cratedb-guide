:::{grid-item-card} AWS DMS Processor
:link: ctk:io/dms/index
:link-type: doc
A full-load-and-cdc pipeline using AWS DMS and CrateDB, where an Amazon Kinesis Data
Stream is selected as a DMS target, combined with a CrateDB-specific downstream
processor element.
+++
AWS DMS supports both `full-load` and continuous replication `cdc` operation modes,
which are often combined (`full-load-and-cdc`).
CrateDB supports two ways to run AWS DMS migrations:
Either standalone/onâ€‘premises, or fully managed with AWS and CrateDB Cloud.
