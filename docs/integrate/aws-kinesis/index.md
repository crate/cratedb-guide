[Amazon Kinesis Data Streams] is a serverless streaming data service that
simplifies the capture, processing, and storage of data streams at any
scale, such as application logs, website clickstreams, and IoT telemetry
data, for machine learning (ML), analytics, and other applications.

You can use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to collect and process large streams of data
records in real time. A typical Kinesis Data Streams application reads data from a
data stream as data records.
