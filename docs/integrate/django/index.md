[Django] makes it easier to build better web apps more quickly and with less code.

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and
clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of
the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing
to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source. 

- **Ridiculously fast**: Django was designed to help developers take applications
  from concept to completion as quickly as possible.

- **Reassuringly secure**: Django takes security seriously and helps developers
  avoid many common security mistakes.

- **Exceedingly scalable**: Some of the busiest sites on the web leverage Django’s
  ability to quickly and flexibly scale.
