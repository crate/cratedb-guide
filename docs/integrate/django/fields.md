# Fields

While most built-in fields work out of the box, it's recommended to use the fields from `cratedb_django.fields`. All
django fields are available in `cratedb_django.fields`. These fields enhance compatability and provide unique
CrateDB features.

## Shared functionality

All fields share functionalities regarding CrateDB column definitions.

* `db_index=False` disable index creation. Example: `TextField(db_index=False)`

## CrateDB specific fields

Fields that have a different implementation than their natives counterparts.


### `AutoUUIDField`

This field automatically generates an elasticflake (unique id), it's recommended to be used as a primary key. It is
the recommended `AUTO` field for the `id` column.

The value is generated by the database and returned to Django upon creation.

```python
class UniquePerson(CrateModel):
    name = fields.TextField()
    uid = fields.AutoUUIDField(primary_key=True)
    class Meta:
        app_label = "test_app"
        
person = UniquePerson.objects.create(name='edwards')
print(person.uid)
