The [AWS DMS Integration with CrateDB] uses Amazon Kinesis Data Streams as
a DMS target, combined with a CrateDB-specific downstream processor element.

CrateDB supports two ways to run AWS DMS migrations:
Either standalone/onâ€‘premises, or fully managed with AWS and CrateDB Cloud.

AWS DMS supports both `full-load` and `cdc` operation modes, which are often
combined (`full-load-and-cdc`).
