# Using `jcmd` with CrateDB

:::{rubric} Introduction
:::
Since JDK 8, `jcmd` is the designated successor of different tools used before
(`jstack`, `jinfo`, `jmap`). It can be used to perform various diagnostic tasks
on a running Java application, such as performing a heap dump, thread dump, and
so on.

> The [jcmd] utility is used to send diagnostic command requests to the JVM,
where these requests are useful for controlling Java Flight Recordings,
troubleshoot, and diagnose JVM and Java Applications. It must be used on
the same machine where the JVM is running, and have the same effective user
and group identifiers that were used to launch the JVM.

:::{code} console
$ /crate/jdk/bin/jcmd -h
Usage: jcmd <pid | main class> <command ...|PerfCounter.print|-f file>
   or: jcmd -l
   or: jcmd -h

  command must be a valid jcmd command for the selected jvm.
  Use the command "help" to see which commands are available.
  If the pid is 0, commands will be sent to all Java processes.
  The main class argument will be used to match (either partially
  or fully) the class used to start Java.
  If no options are given, lists Java processes (same as -l).

  PerfCounter.print display the counters exposed by this process
  -f  read and execute commands from the file
  -l  list JVM processes on the local machine
  -? -h --help print this help message

:::{rubric} Help
:::
`jcmd <PID> help` lists all available commands that you can use to troubleshoot
CrateDB.
:::{code} console
/crate/jdk/bin/jcmd 1 help
:::
For more information about a specific command, use `help <command>`.

A monitoring tool that collects information about the events in a Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) during the execution of a Java application. JFR is part of the
JDK distribution, and it is integrated into the JVM.
