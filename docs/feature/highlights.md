# Feature highlights

Important fundamental features of CrateDB, and how they are applied within software
solutions and application platforms in different scenarios and environments.

:{material-outlined}`article;1.75em` {ref}`Document store <document>`:

  Store JSON documents or other structured data, also nested, using
  CrateDBâ€™s OBJECT and ARRAY container data types. 
  Query this data with ease, fully indexed thus performant from the
  start, optionally using relational joins.

  **What's inside:**
  CrateDB can do the same like Lotus Notes / Domino, CouchDB, MongoDB,
  and PostgreSQL's JSON data type.

:{material-outlined}`manage_search;2em` {ref}`Unified search <search-overview>`:

  Based on Apache Lucene, CrateDB offers native BM25 term search
  and vector search, all using SQL.
  Learn about how to set up your database for search,
  and how to query data efficiently, to make sense
  of large volumes of unstructured information.
  
  **What's inside:**
  Like Elasticsearch and Solr, CrateDB is based on Lucene, the premier
  industry-grade full-text search engine library.


:{material-outlined}`engineering;2em` {ref}`Advanced querying <query>`:

  Mix full-text search with time series aspects, and run powerful
  aggregations or other kinds of complex queries on your data. 
  CrateDB supports effective time series analysis with fast aggregations,
  relational features for JOIN operations, and a rich set of built-in functions.
  
  **What's inside:**
  Aggregations with gap filling / interpolation, common table expressions (CTEs),
  LAG / LEAD window functions, time bucketing, HyperLogLog, LOCF/NOCB, LTTB, UNNEST.
