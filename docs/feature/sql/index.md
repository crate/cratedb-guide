CrateDB is wire-protocol compatible to PostgreSQL, and you can use all of its
features using plain SQL.
Other than integrating well with commodity systems using standard database
access interfaces like ODBC or JDBC, it provides a proprietary HTTP interface
on top.

You have a variety of options to connect to CrateDB, and to integrate it with
off-the-shelve, 3rd-party, open-source, and proprietary applications.

See {ref}`connect`.
