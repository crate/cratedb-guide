:::{rubric} Features
:::

CrateDB offers robust search capabilities by combining native full-text,
geospatial, vector, and hybrid search—all accessible through standard SQL
queries. At its core, CrateDB leverages Apache Lucene and the BM25 ranking
algorithm for high-performance full-text search, making it well-suited for
large-scale, complex information retrieval tasks.

Geospatial and vector search are also natively supported, enabling use cases
ranging from text analytics to AI/ML and location-based queries, all within
the same unified platform.

:::{rubric} Hybrid search
:::

Hybrid search in CrateDB allows you to combine multiple search methods—such
as term-based, vector, and geospatial—within a single query for powerful
information discovery. This versatility, together with horizontal
scalability and SQL compatibility, makes CrateDB an exceptional choice for
organisations wanting to run advanced search and analytics on diverse data
types, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured content.
