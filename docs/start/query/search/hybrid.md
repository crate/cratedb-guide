# Hybrid search

While **vector search** provides powerful semantic retrieval based on machine learning models, it's not always optimal, especially when models are not fine-tuned for a specific domain. On the other hand, **traditional full-text search** (e.g., BM25 scoring) offers high precision on exact or keyword-based queries, with strong performance out of the box. **Hybrid search** blends these approaches, combining semantic understanding with keyword relevance to deliver more accurate, robust, and context-aware search results.

Hybrid search is particularly effective for **Knowledge bases, Product or document search, Multilingual content search, FAQ bots and semantic assistants**, and **AI-powered search experiences.** It allows applications to go beyond keyword matching, incorporating vector similarity while still respecting domain-specific terms.

CrateDB supports **hybrid search** by combining **vector similarity search** (kNN) and **term-based full-text search** (BM25) in a single SQL query. CrateDB lets you implement hybrid search natively in SQL using **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** and **scoring fusion techniques**, such as:

* **Convex combination** (weighted sum of scores)
* **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**

## Supported Search Capabilities in CrateDB

| Search Type           | Function      | Description                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Vector search**     | `KNN_MATCH()` | Finds vectors closest to a given vector        |
| **Full-text search**  | `MATCH()`     | Uses Lucene's BM25 scoring                     |
| **Geospatial search** | `MATCH()`     | For shapes and points (see: Geospatial Search) |

CrateDB enables all three through **pure SQL**, allowing flexible combinations and advanced analytics.

## Example: Hybrid Search in SQL

Hereâ€™s a simple structure of a hybrid search query combining BM25 and vector results using a CTE:

```sql
WITH 
    vector_results AS (
        SELECT id, title, content, 
               _score AS vector_score
        FROM documents
        WHERE KNN_MATCH(embedding, [0.2, 0.1, ..., 0.3], 10)
    ),
    bm25_results AS (
        SELECT id, title, content, 
               _score AS bm25_score
        FROM documents
        WHERE MATCH(content, 'knn search')
    )

SELECT 
    v.id,
    v.title,
    bm25_score,
    vector_score,
    0.5 * bm25_score + 0.5 * vector_score AS hybrid_score
FROM 
    bm25_results b
JOIN 
    vector_results v ON v.id = b.id
ORDER BY 
    hybrid_score DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

You can adjust the weighting (`0.5`) depending on your desired balance between keyword precision and semantic similarity.
