This section gives you some guidelines on how to get started quickly with CrateDB.
:::

## 1. Create your first cluster

The fastest and easiest way to get started with CrateDB is by
[creating a free CrateDB Cloud cluster][CrateDB Cloud Console].

## 2. Take a starter tutorial

Choose the interactive tutorials that match your interests,
or run them directly in the CrateDB Cloud Console.

* **Working with JSON payloads?** • Analyze **marketing data**. • {{ '{}(#objects-basics)'.format(tutorial) }}

  In this tutorial, explore the dynamic **OBJECT** data type to store and
  query complex, nested, multi-structured data from various platforms.
  You will also discover how to use generated columns to parse and manage
  URLs for deeper insights.

* **Interested in full-text search?** • Explore the **Netflix catalog**. • {{ '{}(#search-basics)'.format(tutorial) }}

  In this tutorial, learn how to use CrateDB Cloud’s full-text search capabilities
  to work with large datasets and manage a collection of Netflix titles.

* **Exploring time-series data?** • Investigate **weather data**. • {{ '{}(#timeseries-querying)'.format(tutorial) }}

  In this tutorial, you’ll work with weather readings from multiple locations
  to learn how to efficiently store and analyze time-series datasets.

## 3. Take an advanced tutorial

* **Analyze Device Readings with Metadata Integration** • {{ '{}(#timeseries-objects)'.format(tutorial) }}
  
  In this tutorial, capture device metrics such as battery level, CPU usage,
  and memory usage, then enrich your time‑series data with JSON and text
  metadata to enable more comprehensive analysis.
