How to get started with CrateDB quickly.
:::

## 1. Create your first cluster

The fastest and easiest way to get started with CrateDB is by
deploying a free tier (CRFREE) cluster on [CrateDB Cloud][CrateDB Cloud Console].

## 2. Take a starter tutorial

Choose the interactive tutorials that match your interests,
or run them directly in the CrateDB Cloud Console.

* **Working with JSON payloads?** Analyze marketing data — see {{ '{}(#objects-basics)'.format(tutorial) }}

  Explore the dynamic **OBJECT** data type for complex, nested, multi‑structured data.
  You'll also use generated columns to parse URLs and manage them for deeper insights.

* **Interested in full-text search?** Explore the Netflix catalog — see {{ '{}(#search-basics)'.format(tutorial) }}

  Learn how to use CrateDB’s full‑text search to explore a large dataset and manage a Netflix title catalog.

* **Exploring time series data?** Investigate weather data — see {{ '{}(#timeseries-querying)'.format(tutorial) }}

  In this tutorial, you’ll work with weather readings from multiple locations
  to learn how to efficiently store and analyze time series datasets.

## 3. Take an advanced tutorial

* **Analyze device readings** with metadata integration — see {{ '{}(#timeseries-objects)'.format(tutorial) }}
  
  In this tutorial, capture device metrics such as battery level, CPU usage,
  and memory usage, then enrich your time series data with JSON and text
  metadata to enable more comprehensive analysis.
