Choose one of two JavaScript (Node.js) drivers:

-{ref}`node-crate` - using HTTP/HTTPS
-{ref}`node-postgres` - using PG Wire Protocol

Prefer the `node-postgres` driver first as it is actively maintained.
It might not support all features and data types of CrateDB. In this case,
`node-crate` is a good second choice.
