# CrateDB and ORM libraries

CrateDB provides dialect support for the following ORM libraries and
frameworks.

## SQLAlchemy

[SQLAlchemy] is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that
gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.

Python-based [DataFrame](df/index.md)
and [ML](#machine-learning) libraries, and a few [ETL](#etl)
frameworks, are using SQLAlchemy as database adapter library when connecting to
[RDBMS].
