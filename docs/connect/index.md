:::{rubric} Protocol Support
:::

CrateDB supports both the HTTP protocol and the PostgreSQL wire protocol,
which ensures that many clients that work with PostgreSQL, will also work with
CrateDB.

Through corresponding drivers, CrateDB is compatible with ODBC,
JDBC, and other database API specifications. By supporting SQL, CrateDB is
compatible with many standard database environments out of the box.

The HTTP protocol can be used to connect from environments where
PostgreSQL-based communication is not applicable.

:::{note}
While it is generally recommended to use the PostgreSQL interface (PG) for maximum
compatibility in PostgreSQL environments, the HTTP interface supports CrateDB
bulk operations and BLOBs, which are not supported by the PostgreSQL
protocol.
