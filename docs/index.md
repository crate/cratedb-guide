CrateDB is a fully open-source **distributed SQL database** designed for
**real-time analytics, search and AI** at scale. Whether you are working with
time series data, full-text search, or large volumes of structured and
semi-structured data, CrateDB gives you the **power of SQL**, the **scalability
of NoSQL**, and the **flexibility of a modern data platform**.
