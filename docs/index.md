> When using CrateDB, a project that got started around the same time, it's like
you've stumbled into an alternative reality where Elastic is a proper database.

> <small>-– Henrik Ingo, Nyrkiö Oy, independent database consultant, MongoDB</small>

> CrateDB enables use cases we couldn't satisfy with other
database systems, also with databases which are even stronger
focused on the time series domain.
