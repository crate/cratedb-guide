:::{rubric} Benefits and Features
:::

Whether you are a developer,
database administrator, or just starting your journey with CrateDB, our
documentation provides the information and knowledge needed to build
real-time analytics and hybrid search applications that leverage CrateDB's
unique features.

* In a unified data platform, CrateDB lets you analyze relational, JSON,
  time series, geospatial, full-text, and vector data in a single system,
  eliminating the need for multiple databases.
* The fully distributed SQL query engine, built on top of Apache Lucene,
  and inheriting technologies from Elasticsearch/OpenSearch, provides performant
  aggregations and advanced SQL features like JOINs and CTEs on large datasets
  of semi-structured data.
* Real-time indexing automatically indexes all columns, including nested
  structures, as data is ingested, eliminating the need to worry about
  indexing strategy.
* The flexible data schema dynamically adapts based on the data you ingest,
  offering seamless integration and instant readiness for analysis.
* Columnar storage enables fast query and aggregation performance.
* PostgreSQL wire protocol compatibility and an HTTP interface provide versatile
  integration capabilities.
* AI-ready: The vector store subsystem integrates well
  with an extensive third-party ecosystem of AI/ML frameworks for advanced data
  analysis and data-driven decisions.
