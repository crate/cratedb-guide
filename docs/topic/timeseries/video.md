and CSV data into CrateDB works, by using the [`COPY FROM`] statement.

Afterwards, it will demonstrate how to export data from CrateDB to a local file
system, using the [`COPY TO`] statement.

For more information about how to import and export
data from/into CrateDB, please refer to [](#import-export).
