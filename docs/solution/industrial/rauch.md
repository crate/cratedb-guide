:::{rubric} About
:::

Rauch is scaling a high-speed production environment with CrateDB, to
ensure real-time production quality control.

> We needed a database that could watch, record and analyze production in
> real time. CrateDB gives us the freedom to be cumulative and scale
> limitless - we found no alternative database with such simplicity and efficiency.

CrateDB helps Rauch to identify and predict production issues and enables access
to production data for many years, with no need for additional infrastructure
while storing one to ten billion records in CrateDB at the same time.

CrateDB enhances FMCG operations by optimizing shop floor efficiency through
real-time equipment monitoring and workflow optimization. It ensures product
quality with integrated quality control measures, reducing defects and waste.
Additionally, CrateDB enhances compliance and traceability by enabling batch
tracking, regulatory reporting, and swift recall capabilities.

In this interview, Arno Breuss, CIO of Rauch Fruchtsäfte, talks about how Rauch
is filling 33 cans per second and how that adds up to 400 data records per second
which are being processed, stored, and analyzed. He explains why their traditional
databases weren't capable of dealing with so many data records and unstructured data.

The presentation outlines the benefits of CrateDB that made Rauch choose CrateDB
over other databases such as PostgreSQL compatibility, support for unstructured
data, and customer support.
