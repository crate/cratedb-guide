:::{rubric} About
:::

TGW Logistics Group implements advanced analytics for automated warehouses
operating across the globe for clients like Amazon, Coop, and
Zalando. Their systems collect a vast amount of data, apply AI to them,
and support all kinds of data-driven applications.

Today's warehouses are complex systems with a very high degree of automation.
TGW simplifies aggregating massive volumes of diverse data with CrateDB.

CrateDB's support for unstructured data, its fast query engine,
scalability, and excellent support, is unparalleled.

> CrateDB is a highly scalable database for time series and event data
> with a very fast query engine using standard SQL.

TGW removed data silos with all different kinds of data formats, data
structures from PLCs, databases, sensor information, etc.

NoSQL databases weren't a sustainable solution for their use case.
After trying multiple database systems, TGW Logistics selected CrateDB for
its ability to aggregate different data formats and the ability to query this
information instantly.

On the migration path, it was easy to start with CrateDB, and now it is at the
heart of everything they are doing, and gives them peace of mind.

**Use case:**
- Accelerate aggregation and access to large volumes of diverse data collected in real-time from warehouse systems around the world.

**Challenges:**
- Data is in many different formats spread across diverse systems worldwide
- Classical and NoSQL databases cannot handle the volume of unstructured and object data
- Data silos are difficult to combine and query, limiting analytics and modeling capabilities

TGW Logistics Group implements key factors to the successful operation of these
warehouses, by having a holistic view on the entire system acquiring data from
various components like sensors, PLCs, embedded controllers, and software
systems.

All the components can effectively be seen as individual "data silos",
distributed across the entire site. Each of them stores just some pieces of
information in various data structures and different ways to access it.
