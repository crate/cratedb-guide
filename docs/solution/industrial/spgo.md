SPGo!, by PETROMIN, has developed a system that allows monitoring mining
material conveyor belts with more than 40,000 sensors in real-time,
processing 760 million records per day, or 120 billion records each year.

By using a predictive algorithm, SPGo! alerts their clients when to conduct
maintenance work on specific equipment (that is set to fail).
This helps the mining customer save resources, costs, and losses due to downtime.
