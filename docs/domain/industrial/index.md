# Industrial Data

Learn how to use CrateDB in industrial / IIoT / Industry 4.0 scenarios within
engineering, manufacturing, and other operational domains.

In the realm of Industrial IoT, dealing with diverse data, ranging from
slow-moving structured data, to high-frequency measurements, presents unique
challenges.

The complexities of industrial big data are characterized by its high variety,
unstructured features, different data sampling rates, and how these attributes
influence data storage, retention, and integration.

Today's warehouses are complex systems with a very high degree of automation.
The key to the successful operation of these warehouses lies in having a
holistic view on the entire system based on data from various components like
sensors, PLCs, embedded controllers and software systems.



## TGW Insights

After trying multiple database systems, TGW Logistics moved to CrateDB for
its ability to aggregate different data formats and ability to query this
information without much hassle.
 
In the second presentation, you will learn how TGW leverages CrateDB to build
digital twins of physical warehouses around the world.
