# Industrial Data

Today's industrial and logistics data acquisition and processing systems
are complex and distributed, with a very high degree of automation.

In the realm of Industrial IoT, dealing with diverse data, ranging from
slow-moving structured data, to high-frequency measurements, presents unique
challenges.
The complexities of industrial big data are characterized by its high variety,
unstructured features, different data sampling rates, and how these attributes
influence data storage, retention, and integration.

Learn how to use CrateDB in long term storage and analytics scenarios for
industrial / IIoT / Industry 4.0 application scenarios within
engineering, manufacturing, production, and logistics, as well as other
operational domains, or within similar environments where billions of data
records from any kinds of machines or devices need to be processed, stored,
and queried.

With CrateDB, compatible to PostgreSQL, you can do all of that using plain SQL.
Other than integrating well with commodity systems using standard database
access interfaces like ODBC or JDBC, it provides a proprietary HTTP interface
on top.

CrateDB helps Rauch to identify and predict production issues and gives access
to production data for many years, with no need for additional infrastructure.

Rauch is filling 33 cans per second and how that adds up to 400 data records
per second which are being processed, stored, and analyzed. In total, they are
within the range of one to ten billion records persisted in CrateDB.

- [Rauch: High-Speed Production Lines]

The use-case of Rauch demonstrates why traditional databases weren't capable to
deal with so many data records and unstructured data. The benefits of CrateDB
made Rauch choose it over other databases, such as PostgreSQL compatibility,
the support for unstructured data, and its excellent customer support.

- [TGW: Fixing data silos in a high-speed logistics environment]

TGW states that all these components can be seen as "data silos",
distributed across the entire site, each of them storing just some pieces of
information in various data structures and different ways to access it.

After trying multiple database systems, TGW Logistics moved to CrateDB for
its ability to aggregate different data formats and the ability to query this
information without further ado.
