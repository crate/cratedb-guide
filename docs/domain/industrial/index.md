# Industrial Data

Today's industrial and logistics data acquisition and processing systems
are complex and distributed, with a very high degree of automation.

Learn how to use CrateDB in industrial / IIoT / Industry 4.0 scenarios within
engineering, manufacturing, production, and logistics, as well as other
operational domains, or within similar environments where billions of data
records from any kinds of machines or devices need to be processed, stored,
and queried.

In the realm of Industrial IoT, dealing with diverse data, ranging from
slow-moving structured data, to high-frequency measurements, presents unique
challenges.
The complexities of industrial big data are characterized by its high variety,
unstructured features, different data sampling rates, and how these attributes
influence data storage, retention, and integration.

With CrateDB, compatible to PostgreSQL, you can do all of that using plain SQL,
with excellent integration capabilities into commodity systems using standard
database access interfaces like ODBC or JDBC, and a proprietary HTTP interface
on top.

Rauch is filling 33 cans per second and how that adds up to 400 data records
per second which are being processed, stored, and analyzed. In total, they are
within the range of one to ten billion records persisted in CrateDB.

- [Rauch: High-Speed Production Lines]

The use-case of Rauch demonstrates why traditional databases weren't capable to
deal with so many data records and unstructured data. The benefits of CrateDB
made Rauch choose it over other databases, such as PostgreSQL compatibility,
the support for unstructured data, and its excellent customer support.

760 million records per day. SPGo! trusts CrateDB as a partner on this journey.

- [SPGo!: Monitoring and Predictive Maintenance]

You will learn about many details of this solution, including real-time
component monitoring, predictive failure analysis, management of operations,
data-driven predictive maintenance, large daily data intakes, and KPIs that
help the mining businesses save resources, workforce, and losses, due to
decreased downtime.

_CrateDB's support for unstructured data, its fast query engine,
scalability, and excellent support, is unparalleled._

TGW Logistics Group implements advanced analytics for automated warehouses
they are operating across the globe for customers like Amazon, Coop, and
Zalando. Their systems collect a vast amount of data, apply AI to them,
and support all kinds of data-driven applications.

- [TGW: Connected Warehouses]

TGW removed data silos with all different kinds of data formats, data
structures from PLCs, databases, sensor information, etc.

NoSQL databases weren't a sustainable solution for their use case. On the
migration path, it was easy to start with CrateDB, and now it is at the
heart of everything they are doing, and gives them peace of mind.

_Storing, querying, and analyzing industrial IoT data and metadata without
much hassle._

TGW Logistics Group implements key factors to the successful operation of these
warehouses, by having a holistic view on the entire system acquiring data from
various components like sensors, PLCs, embedded controllers, and software
systems.

- [TGW: Fixing data silos in a high-speed logistics environment]

TGW states that all these components can be seen as "data silos",
distributed across the entire site, each of them storing just some pieces of
information in various data structures and different ways to access it.

After trying multiple database systems, TGW Logistics moved to CrateDB for
its ability to aggregate different data formats and the ability to query this
information without further ado.
