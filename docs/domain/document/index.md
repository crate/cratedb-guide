# Document Store

Learn how to efficiently store JSON or other structured data, also nested, and
how to query this data with ease, based on CrateDB's `OBJECT` data type.

Storing documents in CrateDB provides the same development convenience like the
document-oriented storage layer of Lotus Notes / Domino, CouchDB, and MongoDB.
