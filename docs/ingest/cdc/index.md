CrateDB provides a variety of options to connect and integrate with third-party
CDC applications, mostly using [CrateDB's PostgreSQL interface].
CrateDB also provides a few native adapter components that can be used
to leverage its advanced features. 

This documentation section lists corresponding CDC applications and
frameworks which can be used together with CrateDB, and outlines how
to use them optimally.
Please also have a look at support for [generic ETL](#etl) solutions.
