CrateDB provides many options to connect and integrate with third-party
CDC applications, mostly using [CrateDB's PostgreSQL interface].
CrateDB also provides native adapter components to leverage advanced
features.

This documentation section lists corresponding CDC applications and
frameworks which can be used together with CrateDB, and outlines how
to use them optimally.
Please also take a look at support for {ref}`generic ETL <etl>` solutions.
